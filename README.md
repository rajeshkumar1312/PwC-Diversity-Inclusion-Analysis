### My Recommendations

- The company should understand the quotas but its not the automate inclusion, that is hiring more to boost diversity, but won’t automatically create an inclusive culture in the organization.
- Establish a sense of belonging for all employees: employees having a connection to an organization or group of people that makes them feel about themselves will result in greater engagement and productivity.
- In most cases, diversity and inclusion are often treated as a single initiative owned exclusively by the HR, however, for real change to happen, every individual employee has to buy into the value of belonging, the leadership of the organization, therefore, needs to make a deliberate effort in bringing the people together.
